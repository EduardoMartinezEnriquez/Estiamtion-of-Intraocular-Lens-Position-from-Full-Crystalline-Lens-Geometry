# Estimation-of-Intraocular-Lens-Position-from-Full-Crystalline-Lens-Geometry

Data associated to the paper "Estimation of Intraocular lens position from full crystalline lens geometry:  
towards a new generation of intraocular lens power calculation formulas", in Matlab and Excel formats.

Note that main results in Tables 3 and 4 and Figure 5 can be obtained from data for each patient (in 'Supplementary_Fig_1_ELP_estimation_error' and 'Supplementary_Fig_2_RE_estimation_error').
